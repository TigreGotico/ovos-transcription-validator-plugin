# üß† OVOS Transcription Validator Plugin

A plugin for [OVOS](https://openvoiceos.com) that uses a local or remote LLM (e.g., [Ollama](https://ollama.ai)) to validate transcriptions from speech-to-text (STT) before they are processed by your voice assistant.

It helps filter out garbled, nonsensical, or incomplete utterances‚Äîreducing confusion and improving the accuracy of downstream skills.

## ‚ú® Features

- ‚úÖ Multilingual transcription validation
- üß† Powered by LLMs (via Ollama)
- üéØ Filters out invalid utterances before processing
- üîâ Optional feedback via error sound or dialog
- ‚öôÔ∏è Fully configurable

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. The plugin receives an STT transcription and language code.
2. A structured prompt with examples is sent to the LLM.
3. The LLM responds with `True` (valid) or `False` (invalid).
4. If invalid:
   - The utterance is canceled.
   - Optionally, a dialog prompt or error sound is triggered.

## üßæ Default Prompt Template

If no custom prompt is provided, this default multilingual template is used:

```text
You are a multilingual language model helping a voice assistant determine if transcribed user input from speech-to-text (STT) is valid or not.

This system supports user input in multiple languages: English (en), Portuguese (pt), Spanish (es), Catalan (ca), Galician (gl), Basque (eus), Italian (it), French (fr), German (de), Dutch (nl), and Danish (da).

You will receive:
- the language code of the utterance
- the transcribed sentence

Respond only with:
- `True` if the sentence is valid, complete and coherent in the specified language.
- `False` if the sentence is clearly garbled, incomplete, nonsensical, or the result of a transcription error.

### Examples:
Language: en  
Sentence: "Play the next song."  
Answer: True

Language: en  
Sentence: "Potato stop green light now yes."  
Answer: False

Language: pt  
Sentence: "Liga as luzes da sala."  
Answer: True

Language: pt  
Sentence: "C√©u laranja vai cadeira n√£o som."  
Answer: False

### Now evaluate the next sentence.
Language: {lang}  
Sentence: "{transcribed_text}"  
Answer:
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Requirements & Notes

- Requires [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) running locally or accessible over the network.
- You must have a supported model (like `gemma3:1b`) already installed in Ollama.
- The plugin can adapt to different languages based on the LLM's capabilities and training.
